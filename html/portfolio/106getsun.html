        Inspired by the cold and snow of the 2015/16 winter, this app gives you the best weather within 150mi so you can get away from your current snow storm and to sun in no more than three hours.  Being a team project, my main contribution was creating the algorithm that compared the weather conditions around you. (Hint: Highest temperature doesn't win if it's also raining with 20mph winds!)<br />
