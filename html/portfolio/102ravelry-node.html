        <p>Ravlery is a website that I've been using for years to find patterns for knitting and crocheting.  When I learned that they had an API, I thought this could be an interesting opportunity to make a JavaScript interface for it in the form of a NPM package, in case other people wanted to use their info on their personal website or elsewhere.  This project was interesting because I had to think about making the package as easy to use as possible while offerring full access to the API.  Not only that but I had to think about versioning very carefully to not break what others might have already worked on, and offer documentation for it all.  All in all, I'm proud with out it has turned out.</p>
