        <p>At General Assembly, we were tasked by a fake client, Gadoe, to make a restaurant management system for him. My iteration of this project included making separate views for the hosts stand, servers, the kitchen, and managers updating restaurant information.  The server's view is mobile responsive so they can take orders and print a receipt on the go.  There's also the ability for the receipt and other information to be printed in Euros.. you know... for the European patrons.</p>
