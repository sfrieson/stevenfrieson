        <p>New York City is one of the largest cultural hubs in the world, but at the same time, the distribution of the arts isn't even. While in the boundaries of New York, new neighborhoods with even blurrier boundaries are created by the clumping of these arts establishments. Art District, a group project made for the Hack.Summit() 2016 hackathon, helps visualize these boundaries. These new district highlight not only the popular places to be, but also where the art is not.</p>
