                    General Assembly was the biggest risk I've ever taken in my life, and I'm generally not one to gamble.  With this risk I had an amazing experience learning to be a full stack web developer.  Just a week before the class start I read a tutorial on using an HTML form and was crippled.  Now I'm writing SQL database queries, rendering views with Angular, looping through JavaScript arrays and routing POST requests in Express.  Worth it.

                    Starting off just doing projects here and there for friends, I've slowly started doing more freelance work.  Now that I've added web development to my skillset, I'm continue to grow my design skills as I make websites for clients, and continue to support their print needs as well.

                    New York Cares allowed me incredible opportunities that I could not have found elsewhere.  As the graphic designer, I worked on any digital or print need the company had. Most of the time it was business cards, post cards and fliers, but every once in a while I had the chance to design multi-million dollar ad campaigns with highway billboards, MTA Subway posters, and even Times Square digital billboards.
