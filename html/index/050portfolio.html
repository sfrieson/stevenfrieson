                As I've been working on a food blog with my wife for the past couple of years, she came up with an idea for an app that would be help us always know what's in the pantry at home.  Half-way through my experience at General Assembly, I realized that I could actually make this app myself.  With this as the inspiration and our ongoing needs driving the features, I started this app for my final project.<br />

                I always thought it was funny that if you pronounce "guacamole" as you would an English word, it sounds like Whack-A-Mole.  When I learned that my first project at General Assembly needed to be a game, I already had one up my sleeve! Take a whack at an avocado to make some Guac-A-Mole!<br />

                Inspired by the cold and snow of the 2015/16 winter, this app gives you the best weather within 150mi so you can get away from your current snow storm and to sun in no more than three hours.  Being a team project, my main contribution was creating the algorithm that compared the weather conditions around you. (Hint: Highest temperature doesn't win if it's also raining with 20mph winds!)<br />
